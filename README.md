General Usage

Dream Ticket is a social networking site that allows students to connect with their peers and create study groups within a course. With a profile page that clearly lists the courses a student is registered for in a semester, students can easily find other students in the same courses. After creating study groups under a course, students can seek the proper help that they desire from their peers.
